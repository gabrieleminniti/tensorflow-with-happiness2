Before everything you have to: 

--> clone or download the repo:
--> inside tf_files/ you have to create two folders:
  1) models
  2) training_summaries
--> download the .tar file with inceptionV3_model at the following link:
http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz
--> extract the folder from the .tgz file and put the folder inside the /models/ 

--> have fun!
