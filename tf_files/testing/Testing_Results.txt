If you want to see the perfomances of your model it's easy to do:

1) BEFORE RETRAIN, take a small part of the data (depends of the number of samples that you have)
2) You could compute a robust accuracy with the TF splitting data during retrain:
		80% data --> train  	|		10 % data --> validation		| 10 % data --> test

3) After retrain, you could do prediction and test the goodness of the model
